                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                I’m a Data Science and Computer Science student at the University of Pittsburgh with a strong foundation
                in mathematics and logical problem-solving. My interest in computing grew naturally from math —
                I’m drawn to problems where structure, efficiency, and clear reasoning matter, and where the goal is
                to find not just a solution, but the most effective one.
                </p>

                <p>
                I’m especially motivated by problems involving optimization, efficiency, and sustainability. Whether
                I’m working with data, algorithms, or systems, I approach challenges by breaking them down
                mathematically, designing logical strategies, and iterating toward clean, reliable solutions.
                Computer science and data science appeal to me because they reward this way of thinking while also
                encouraging collaboration and real-world impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                Through coursework, internships, and projects, I’ve worked with Python, Java, SQL, and R across areas
                such as data analysis, machine learning, and backend systems. I enjoy turning messy, unstructured data
                into clear insights and building tools that people can actually use. Teaching and mentoring others —
                through roles like peer tutoring and teaching assistance — has also strengthened how I communicate
                technical ideas and think about problems from multiple perspectives.
                </p>

                <p>
                Outside of academics, I play water polo and basketball, which have shaped how I think about teamwork,
                discipline, and performance under pressure. I’m also involved in cultural organizations and enjoy
                mentoring others, experiences that reinforce my interest in working on problems that matter beyond
                the classroom.
                </p>

                <p>
                Looking ahead, I see myself working as a data scientist with additional AI expertise, applying
                data-driven and algorithmic thinking to impactful domains such as healthcare, transportation and
                logistics, or sports analytics.
